# Accessibility Features Verification

## Implemented Accessibility Features for CountdownTimer

### 1. Semantic HTML Structure

- ✅ Used `<section>` element with proper `role="region"`
- ✅ Replaced generic `<Text>` with semantic `<Heading>` for titles
- ✅ Used proper heading hierarchy (`h2` for section titles)

### 2. ARIA Labels and Attributes

- ✅ `aria-labelledby` connects content to section title
- ✅ `aria-describedby` connects content to status description
- ✅ `aria-live="polite"` for countdown updates (non-intrusive)
- ✅ `aria-live="assertive"` for "today is the day" (important announcement)
- ✅ `aria-atomic="true"` ensures complete message is read
- ✅ `role="status"` for important state changes
- ✅ `aria-label` provides descriptive text for screen readers

### 3. Screen Reader Support

- ✅ Descriptive labels for countdown numbers (e.g., "42 days remaining until the wedding")
- ✅ Proper announcement of state changes
- ✅ Emoji descriptions for screen readers
- ✅ Live regions for dynamic content updates

### 4. Color Contrast and Readability

- ✅ Enhanced color contrast:
  - Error state: `gray.700` on `gray.50` (improved from `gray.600`)
  - Today state: `green.800` title, `green.700` text on `green.50` background
  - Past state: `gray.700` title, `gray.600` text on `gray.50` background
  - Future state: `gray.700` title, `brand.600` text on `gray.50` background
- ✅ Maintained readable font weights and sizes
- ✅ Used semantic color meanings (green for success/celebration)

### 5. Keyboard Navigation

- ✅ Component is properly focusable within the page flow
- ✅ No interactive elements that require special keyboard handling
- ✅ Maintains proper tab order in the page

## Requirements Compliance

### Requirement 2.2: Accessibility Standards

- ✅ ARIA labels and semantic HTML implemented
- ✅ Screen reader support with live regions
- ✅ Proper heading hierarchy and landmarks

### Requirement 2.4: Keyboard Navigation

- ✅ Component integrates properly with keyboard navigation flow
- ✅ No keyboard traps or accessibility barriers

## Testing Recommendations

To verify these accessibility features:

1. **Screen Reader Testing**: Use NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver to test announcements
2. **Keyboard Navigation**: Tab through the page to ensure proper focus flow
3. **Color Contrast**: Use tools like WebAIM's contrast checker
4. **Automated Testing**: Run axe-core or similar accessibility testing tools

## Browser Developer Tools Verification

Use browser accessibility tools to verify:

- Proper ARIA attributes are present
- Semantic HTML structure is correct
- Color contrast ratios meet WCAG standards
- Live regions are properly configured
