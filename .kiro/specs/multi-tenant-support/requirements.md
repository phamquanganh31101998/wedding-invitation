# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the single-tenant wedding invitation website into a multi-tenant platform that can serve multiple couples simultaneously. Each tenant (couple) will have their own isolated data, customized content, and unique subdomain or path-based access while sharing the same underlying application infrastructure.

## Glossary

- **Multi_Tenant_System**: The wedding invitation platform that serves multiple couples simultaneously
- **Tenant**: A couple using the platform for their wedding invitation website
- **Tenant_Identifier**: A unique identifier (subdomain or path segment) that distinguishes one tenant from another
- **Tenant_Data**: All data belonging to a specific tenant including RSVP responses, wedding details, and customizations
- **Tenant_Isolation**: The security boundary ensuring one tenant cannot access another tenant's data

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a wedding guest, I want to access a specific couple's wedding website so that I can view their invitation details and RSVP.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a guest accesses a tenant-specific URL, THE Multi_Tenant_System SHALL identify the correct tenant from the Tenant_Identifier
2. WHEN a valid tenant is identified, THE Multi_Tenant_System SHALL serve the wedding website with that tenant's customized content
3. WHEN an invalid Tenant_Identifier is provided, THE Multi_Tenant_System SHALL display a tenant not found error page
4. THE Multi_Tenant_System SHALL ensure all content displayed belongs only to the identified tenant
5. WHEN a guest submits an RSVP, THE Multi_Tenant_System SHALL store the response in the correct tenant's data

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a couple using the platform, I want my wedding data to be completely separate from other couples so that our privacy and data security are maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Multi_Tenant_System SHALL implement Tenant_Isolation for all data storage operations
2. WHEN any data query is executed, THE Multi_Tenant_System SHALL filter results by the current tenant context
3. THE Multi_Tenant_System SHALL prevent cross-tenant data access through all API endpoints
4. WHEN a tenant is deleted, THE Multi_Tenant_System SHALL remove all associated Tenant_Data without affecting other tenants
5. THE Multi_Tenant_System SHALL encrypt sensitive tenant data at rest and in transit

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a couple using the platform, I want my wedding website to have good performance so that my guests have a smooth experience when viewing our invitation and submitting RSVPs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple tenants are active simultaneously, THE Multi_Tenant_System SHALL maintain response times under 2 seconds for page loads
2. THE Multi_Tenant_System SHALL implement caching strategies that respect Tenant_Isolation
3. WHEN tenant data is accessed, THE Multi_Tenant_System SHALL use efficient database queries with proper indexing
4. THE Multi_Tenant_System SHALL handle concurrent RSVP submissions from multiple tenants without performance degradation
5. WHEN system load increases, THE Multi_Tenant_System SHALL scale resources while maintaining tenant separation
